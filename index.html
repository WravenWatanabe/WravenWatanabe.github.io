    </p>About me:<p>
    </p>I am a third-year Data Science and Math student at Northeastern University. 
      Some of my hobbies include watching anime, ice skating, and reading. 
      I also love to draw. At my first co-op I was a QA tester at the New England Journal of Medicine.
      I worked on a medical teaching game called Healer, which simulates the clinical reasoning 
      process of diagnosing a patient. For my next co-op I'm interested in working in bio informatics.
